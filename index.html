<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name of Eric comes from the son of a Preacher. Mom liked the example of that Eric and decided to have my name also be Eric.
        I've met this preacher son at a community event in Shiprock, NM and noted minimal similarities. My father's name is Ernest, of which
    he thought I was named after him. The source of the name Eric is known by my mother and myself.</p>
    <p>The last name Manolito, comes from my father during the time of birth. Father's last name is Manuelito, the common
    Navajo last name Manuelito. Father decided to have mine be Manolito without the letters ue and replaced with
    just an o. I continue to pronounce Manolito as Manuelito.</p>
