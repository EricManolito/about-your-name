<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name of Eric comes from the son of a Preacher. Mom liked the example of that Eric and decided to have my name also be Eric.
        I've met this preacher son at a community event in Shiprock, NM and noted minimal similarities. My father's name is Ernest, of which
    he thought I was named after him. The source of the name Eric is known by my mother and myself.</p>
    <p>The last name Manolito, comes from my father during the time of birth. Father's last name is Manuelito, the common
    Navajo last name Manuelito. Father decided to have mine be Manolito without the letters ue and replaced with
    just an o. I continue to pronounce Manolito as Manuelito.</p>
    <h2>Interests I have:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking - noodles, stews, cookies, etc.</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
        <li>Music - rock, EDM, jazz, classical, etc.</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
    </ul>
<p> During the COVID times of 2020, I wanted to have certain foods that were closed to the public. Rather than not have these
delicious items, I decided to learn about cooking certain dishes. Growing up in rural Cuba, NM. my sisters and mother were the
example of cooking. Fantastic growth and since then, working on more cooking items like an Instant Pot, Air fryer, baking, and
continued noodle dishes.</p>
<p>Photography has been ongoing since 1996 when I got my disposable cameras. That changed to a video camera use in High School.</p>
